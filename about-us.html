            <p>Ellen has more than 25 years of experience conducting applied research and program evaluation, both internationally and in the United States.  Areas she has worked in include family planning, teen pregnancy prevention, innovations in health care, primary health care, healthy relationships, education, and community development.</p>
            <p>Ellen is driven by a desire to help mission-driven organizations obtain the information they need to improve their programs and enhance their impact. After working for large research organizations for many years, she founded Insight Evaluation in 2020 to be able to focus on the types of projects she is most passionate about and to work more closely with organizations at the community level. Her experience includes qualitative and quantitative research, development of logic models and evaluation plans, needs assessments, performance measures, and reporting.</p>
            <p>Ellen currently serves as President of the North Carolina Evaluators Network, and she is an active member of the American Evaluation Association. Outside the office, she loves to garden, travel, study languages, play board games, and enjoy good food. Since acquiring a new puppy in 2022, she has been spending extensive time at the dog park and developing her dog training skills. She lives in the woods just outside Chapel Hill, NC, with her husband and puppy.</p>
