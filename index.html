              <p class="testimonial-quote">Ellen and I have worked together for over 15 years on many research and evaluation projects regarding reproductive and educational issues; they have often required considerable innovation to meet challenging client, budget and time constraints. She draws upon her substantial experience with designing and implementing quantitative and qualitative approaches to collaborate with the client to craft a tailor-made solution to challenges at each stage.  On top of it all, she's a pleasure to work with!</p>

              <p class="testimonial-quote">Ellen is truly an expert in qualitative research/evaluation design and data collection. Her research design process is incredibly thoughtful, taking into account all sorts of factors to ensure accuracy and representativeness. As a collaborator and focus group facilitator, she is always asking the questions that get us closer to understanding the objective or understanding the true lived experience of those we are interested in hearing from. I so much appreciated her ability to distill complex findings into easy to understand recommendations and insights. In short, Ellen is a joy to work with and is a collaborator that brings incredible value to projects. I'm looking forward to working with her again!</p>

              <p class="testimonial-quote">Insight Evaluation's support on our sexual education programs has been extremely helpful. The perspective they have brought to our programs has helped streamline the evaluation process, improve our data collection methods, and ensure that the evaluations are reflective of what our organization needs to determine the impact of our services.

              <p class="testimonial-quote">I have loved working with Dr. Wilson as an evaluation mentor!  She brings years of experience as a researcher, which means she knows the field and current methodologies.  I have become more confident on my recent project because of her insights and wisdom.  She possesses a perfect balance of confidence and listening, so our conversations always have a "team feeling." This is important to me, as we decide how to best provide data and meaning to my client so they can make decisions and keep growing.  I would work with Dr. Wilson again in a heartbeat!</p>
