    <!-- PROGRAM EVALUATION -->
    <section id="program-evaluation" class="service-detail">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Program Evaluation</h2>

        <p class="large">Program evaluation can give you answers to questions such as:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>How was the program implemented?</li>
          <li>What challenges were encountered?</li>
          <li>Is the program having the impacts we expect?</li>
          <li>Is it working better for some people than others?</li>
          <li>Is it having any unintended consequences?</li>
          <li>What can we do to make the program work better?</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="large">We work with you to design a practical, feasible evaluation tailored to your needs. Our methods include surveys, in-depth interviews, focus groups, and observations. We take a collaborative approach to all phases of the evaluation, including identification of evaluation questions, evaluation design, and interpretation and dissemination of results.</p>

        <p class="large">We can present results in various formats, according to your needs. These may include reports, briefs, presentations, journal articles, dashboards, newsletters, informal meetings, webinars, town halls, or other means.</p>

    <!-- RESEARCH -->
    <section id="research" class="service-detail">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Research</h2>

        <p class="large">Research can help you to better understand the needs in your community, what types of interventions work best, and how to design interventions to increase their effectiveness. Research findings can also help you make the case for the work you want to do in grant proposals. Research strategies may include surveys, key informant interviews, town halls, focus-group discussions, observations, pre-testing of processes and materials, and literature reviews.</p>

        <p class="large">In addition to more traditional research, we can conduct rapid-cycle research, integrating concepts from human-centered design, to help you iteratively identify problems and develop, test, and refine solutions.</p>

    <!-- PERFORMANCE MEASURES -->
    <section id="performance-measures" class="service-detail">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Performance Measures</h2>

        <p class="large">Many federally-funded programs require the collection and reporting of performance measure data, such as dosage, reach, fidelity, training, program quality, and outcomes. We can help you develop systems to collect, aggregate, and report your performance-measure data.</p>

        <h2>Grant Writing</h2>

        <p class="large">We can help you obtain the funding you need to support and expand your programs. We provide grant-writing services that can save you time and increase the likelihood of a successful application, including:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Drafting a clear, persuasive proposal</li>
          <li>Review and/or edit drafts</li>
          <li>Ensure compliance with all grant requirements</li>
